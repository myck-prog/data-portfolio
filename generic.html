								<p>	<b>What's my background?</b>
									<br>
									Hi, I'm Myckland Matthew. With a robust background from SFU Statistics and significant experience as a Data Analyst, I have seamlessly integrated skills from my previous role as a Software Developer (Research)	 and IS Busines Analyst into more complex analytical roles. My expertise encompasses not only rigorous analytical skills—such as identifying business needs, analyzing workflows, and visualizing processes—but also extends to system implementation, software development and project management. Throughout my data analytics certifications, I enhanced these skills by engaging in diverse data projects. I am eager to leverage my analytical prowess and broad experience in a new opportunity, where I can continue to grow and contribute effectively.
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>Me and data analytics.</b>
									<br>
									In my capacity as a Data Analyst, I possess proficient technical skills in SQL, Python, R, SAS and Tableau. My expertise lies in analyzing, manipulating, and visualizing data to discern patterns and trends, aiding in addressing pertinent business inquiries. I particularly relish the aspect of data visualization, finding great satisfaction in translating information into user-friendly dashboards. Witnessing the transformative potential of data is endlessly intriguing. Whether it's the minutiae of daily financial tracking for comparative analysis or the broader scope of forecasting, AI optimization, and purchase behavior analysis, I am driven to provide data-driven solutions.
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>Who am I?</b>
									<br>
									In addition to my love for data, I'm detail-oriented and have a growth mindset. I'm big on clear communication, preferring to start with the big picture and then dive into the specifics. I pay close attention to detail when analyzing data, and I enjoy the challenge of working with statistics. People often describe me as cheerful and positive, and I'm always open to feedback and learning from my mistakes. I'm a quick learner and believe in doing things well, going above and beyond when needed. I'm also curious and enjoy trying new things, whether it's participating in hackathons or joining university clubs. Outside of work, I like to stay creative by writing and playing the drums, and I'm always up for networking and learning from others.
									<br>
									<br>
									<b>What's next?</b>
									<br>
									I'm eager and prepared to continue advancing in the field of analytics, whether as a Data Analyst, Analytics Engineer, or Business Intelligence Analyst. Are you interested in collaborating on data analytics projects? I'm enthusiastic about joining forces and contributing to impactful solutions. Let's work together to develop more data-driven solutions and make a positive impact!
